# Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)

## Description
This project implements an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system for autonomous vehicles. The ACC system adjusts the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead and adheres to speed limits.

## Features
- **PID Speed Control**: Maintains the desired speed while adjusting to the speed of the leading vehicle.
- **Distance Control**: Ensures a safe following distance using a PID controller.
- **Speed Limit Adherence**: Adjusts the vehicle's speed to comply with predefined speed limits.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. You will also need `numpy` and `matplotlib` for the simulations.

## Code Structure
acc_control.py: The main script that runs the ACC simulation.
Vehicle: Class representing the vehicle's state and behavior.
SpeedController: Class implementing the PID controller for maintaining the desired speed.
DistanceController: Class implementing the PID controller for maintaining a safe following distance.

## Example Output
The simulation will generate plots showing:

The vehicle's speed over time.
The distance to the leading vehicle over time.
The control signals for speed and distance adjustments.

##Future Work
Integration with real-time sensor data.
Implementation of more advanced control algorithms (e.g., Adaptive Control, Reinforcement Learning).


Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
